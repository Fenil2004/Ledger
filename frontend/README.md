# Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a React + Tailwind prototype for the ledger app. It expects the backend API to run at `http://localhost:4000` and uses Vite's built-in PostCSS pipeline.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed Vite URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
